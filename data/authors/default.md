Dear reader,

I'm Boopathi Rajaa, a developer working on projects using GraphQL, TypeScript, and other similar topics. I use this website to write about the topics above as my personal blog.

I'm really excited to share some of the technical challenges I face during work or open-source and my take on solving or approaching such a challenge. I hope you find the content on this website helpful. Thank you for reading through my scribblings.
